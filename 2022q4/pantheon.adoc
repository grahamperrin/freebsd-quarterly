The Pantheon desktop environment is designed for elementary OS.
It builds on GNOME technologies (such as Mutter, GTK 3 and 4) and it is written in Vala. The goal is to have a new desktop for users.

*13.1-RELEASE or higher is required*, because several core components depend on `deskutils/xdg-desktop-portal`.

The repository contains Mk/Uses framework `elementary.mk`, official applications, and curated ports which depend on `x11-toolkits/granite`.

Since the previous report, we have been updating its related ports, especially:

* `deskutils/elementary-calendar` update to link:https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=267797[6.1.2]
* `deskutils/iconbrowser`
* `graphics/elementary-photos`
* `math/elementary-calculator`
* `multimedia/elementary-videos`
* `x11/elementary-terminal`
* `x11-themes/gnome-icons-elementary`
* `x11-toolkits/granite7`

Power manager plugins for top panel (wingpanel) and control center (switchboard) are finished.

A new switchboard plugin is also available, `net/switchboard-plug-sharing`. Ported *Rygel*, GNOME UPnP/DLNA services.

Submitted other patches for low level libraries such as:

* `print/cups-pk-helper` update to link:https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=266067[0.2.7] required by `print/switchboard-plus-printers`
* `devel/libgee` update to link:https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=266585[0.20.6] heavily uses by the desktop
* `sysutils/polkit` update to 122 link:https://reviews.freebsd.org/D37137[D37137]
* `sysutils/accountsservice` update to 22.08.8 link:https://reviews.freebsd.org/D37679[D37679]
